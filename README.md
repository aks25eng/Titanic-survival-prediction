## Problem statement -
we have a dataset of a ship sinking due to ice berg accident, in this dataset their are several parameters presents of passengers travelling in the ship. Based on this parameter predict weather they survived the accident or not .

## Work flow -
  1- Importing the dataset file , 
  2- Data preprocessing to know the data we are working with ,
  3- Data analysis using plots and graphs to understand the parameters ,
  4- Spliting the data into training data and testing data ,
  5- Model selection for prediction ( Logistic Regression model is used as we are dealing with binary data output and it works well for binary classification)
  6- Fitting the data parameters into the model ,
  7- Evaluating the performance of the model ,
